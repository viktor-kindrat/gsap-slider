# Slider

My practise of using GSAP. I had made a Slider animation using GSAP ScrollTrigger with onMouseMove effects made with GSAP MotionPathPlugin. This is one part of bigger commercial project.

Notice that you need to scroll down to see an effect. Fixed block on the top of page simulates header.

Thanks for exploring my repos ðŸ§¡
